    "\n",
    "Let's explore some toy datasets, and see what's in there.  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) is our tool of choice for both data wrangling and also a basic descriptive analysis. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is the tool we will be using to do our graphical EDA, but it is also true that much of this can be accomplished (uglier, slower) in Pandas. You will find the docs on these websites to be very useful... always have them open in another browser tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will show you [Missingno]() a tool that you might find useful to explore missing data.  This is a much simpler package than the others, but I often find it useful. It certainly isn't nearly as common to see out in the wild as the first two.\n",
